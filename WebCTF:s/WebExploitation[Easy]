Crack the Gate 1
In this Challenge i get a email, link to a website with a login form and a hint that guessing techniques dont work aswell as "developer left a secret way in"
So i start by checking the Page Source  where i find a comment that says to remove previous comment and the previous comment still there but unreadable.
Since this string is only letter i assumed it would be some kind of Ceaser cipher and put it into CybeChef and tried rot13 and got "use header X-Dev-Access: yes"
Went bakc to login form went into inspect mode, then network pressed reload for the requests. After inputing the email aswell as a random password it went into the request and added anotehr header namely the X-Dev-Access: yes.
After pressing send i get successful request wiht status code 200. I then check the response on the right side and see that there is a flag written there.

IntroToBurp
In this Challenge i get a link to a website with a Registration form and after that a 2fa authentication OTP form were no matter what i write i get "Invalid OTP".
Since the name of teh game is Burp i load up Brupsuite and open the link in the Port swigger. After intercepting all requests and analying them and trying to change cookies and my input aswell as type(POST,GET)
I concluded i have no idea what to do so Google it is, and after a while didn't get much smarter for this specific challenge so took a hint from the website which told me to try mangling the request and so i did.
i at random deleted half the request and there popped the flag out
